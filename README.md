What is it?
---------

Rock-Paper-Scissors challenge is the classic game made with the Sinatra
framework, using Capybara/RSpec for TDD. A player selects one of the three
choices, and the computer chooses one randomly, a winner is nominated.
The User stories were the following:

```
As a player
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a player
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Build Process

I made this challenge the TDD way, by writing the Capybara/Rspec Unit/Feature
tests before my actual code.
